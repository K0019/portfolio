# Portfolio

Hello! This is a list of some game projects that I have worked on in the past. Each folder is a game project with the starting numbers indicating the year and month that it was completed on. Inside is a text file containing the description of the project and my contribution, as well as at least two of the following: executable, screenshots and trailers.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio!
