The Last Defender
August 2024 - April 2025

I was the tech lead in this DigiPen 2D game project consisting of 5 other programmers and 1 designer/artist. I mainly worked on core engine systems but also helped others in the team when they needed help with their game systems.

Some of the systems that I worked on:
- Engine architecture
- ECS (Entity-Component System)
- Scene Management
- Physics
- Scripting
- Serialization
- Camera Shake
- And more.
