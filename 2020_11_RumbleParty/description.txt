Rumble Party
September 2020 - November 2020 (3 months)

This was my Final Year Project where I was the main programmer, alongside 1 other programmer and 2 artists, where we made this VR party game in UE4. I mainly worked on base mechanics like networking and VR input while the other programmer worked on the different game stages.

Main areas that I worked on:
- Networking
- VR input
- Player Character
- Game 3 (Balloon Frenzy)
- Main Menu
