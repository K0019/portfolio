Sorcerous Synthesis
August 2024 - December 2024 (4 months)

I was the tech lead and project manager in this DigiPen 2D puzzle game C project, that I also proposed the game idea of, consisting of 4 other programmers. As this was the first game project for every other programmer in my team, I took on a mentorship role, guiding everyone on how to implement their features in code. In this project, we built the game on top of a simple engine base provided by DigiPen.

Some notable systems that I worked on:
- Engine architecture & GameObject system
- Scene Management & Transition
- File Loading
- Camera & Screen Effect
- Particles
- Path drawing
